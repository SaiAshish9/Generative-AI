# Generative-AI

```
AI can be classified into two categpries:

1. GenAI

Generating new content like text, images, video, audio

for example ChatGPT


2. Non GenAI

We've data and based on that we are making certain decisions:

a. XRAY: A person has disease or not. 
b. Person should be given loan or not based on credit history data.


Evolution of GenAI:

Early days predicting home price

In the following pic:

Area, Bedrooms and Age are the simple features.

Complex Features:

```
Hence, we can't simply use features for image detection hence therefore neural networks were invented and that had given birth to deep learning.

After that came RNN

RNN is used for solving problems like language translation where we provide words to the network.

An RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is a type of neural network particularly well-suited for sequential data. Unlike traditional feedforward networks, RNNs have loops that allow information to persist, making them ideal for tasks involving time-series, text, audio, or any data where the order matters.

In Gmail it will try to autocomplete
