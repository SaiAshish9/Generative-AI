```
AI can be classified into two categpries:

1. GenAI

Generating new content like text, images, video, audio

for example ChatGPT


2. Non GenAI

We've data and based on that we are making certain decisions:

a. XRAY: A person has disease or not. 
b. Person should be given loan or not based on credit history data.

Evolution of GenAI:

Early days predicting home price

In the following pic:

Area, Bedrooms and Age are the simple features.

```
Hence, we can't simply use features for image detection hence therefore neural networks were invented and that had given birth to deep learning.

```
RNN is used for solving problems like language translation where we provide words to the network.
An RNN (Recurrent Neural Network) is a type of neural network particularly well-suited for sequential data. Unlike traditional feedforward networks, 
RNNs have loops that allow information to persist, making them ideal for tasks involving time-series, text, audio, or any data where the order matters.

BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) is a groundbreaking language model developed by Google AI in 2018.
It's designed to understand the context of words in a sentence more deeply than previous models, thanks to its bidirectional nature.

```
Embeddings And Vector Data
```

```
Vector data allows us to store the embeddings
```

```
Semantic search means not searching using the exact keyword matching. But understanding the intent of a user query.
Using the context to perform the search.
Semantic search internally uses the concept of embedding. Numerical representation of text.
```

```
üîπ What Are Embeddings?

Embeddings are numerical representations of complex data (like text, images, audio, etc.) in a high-dimensional vector space.
They allow machines to understand the relationships and similarities between different pieces of data.
Think of embeddings as turning something like a word or sentence into a list of numbers (a vector) that captures its semantic meaning.

üîπ What Is Vector Data?

Vector data simply refers to this list of numbers (the output of embeddings). It's usually a floating-point array, like:
[0.13, -0.98, 0.56, ..., 0.24]  ‚Üê  (typically 128, 256, 512, or 768+ dimensions)

These vectors are then used for:
Similarity search
Clustering
Recommendation engines
Anomaly detection
Semantic search

üîπ Example Use Case: Text Embeddings
Let‚Äôs say you have two sentences:
‚ÄúI love pizza.‚Äù
‚ÄúPizza is amazing.‚Äù

After generating embeddings using a model like OpenAI‚Äôs text-embedding-3-small, their vectors might look like this:

Sentence A ‚Üí [0.11, -0.23, 0.99, ...]
Sentence B ‚Üí [0.12, -0.25, 1.01, ...]

You can then calculate the cosine similarity between these vectors to determine that they're semantically close.

üîπ Common Models to Generate Embeddings

OpenAI Embedding Models (e.g., text-embedding-3-small)
BERT / SBERT (Sentence-BERT)
CLIP (for image and text)
FastText, Word2Vec, GloVe (older models)

üîπ Tools to Store/Search Vector Data
Once you have embeddings, you can store them in vector databases:

FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search)
Pinecone
Weaviate
Qdrant
Milvus

These allow for efficient nearest neighbor search across millions of vectors.

Summary

Term	Description
Embedding	A numerical representation of data
Vector	The actual list of numbers (embedding result)
Vector DB	Specialized database to store and query vectors
Use Cases	Semantic search, recommendations, classification, etc.

üß† What Are Agents in LLMs?

Agents in the context of LLMs (Large Language Models) are systems or programs that use an LLM as the core reasoning engine, but go a step further by:
1. Planning tasks
2. Interacting with tools, APIs, or environments
3. Maintaining memory or state
4. Autonomously deciding what to do next

They make LLMs interactive, autonomous, and goal-oriented.

üîÑ Analogy:

Think of an LLM as the brain, and an agent as the robot that uses that brain to act in the real world.

‚öôÔ∏è Common Frameworks Using Agents:

LangChain Agents

Choose a tool/function to call based on input and history

Example: Search ‚Üí Read ‚Üí Summarize
1. AutoGPT / BabyAGI
2. Goal-driven agents that recursively break down tasks
3. Can use web, files, or APIs to act autonomously
4. OpenAI Function Calling (with Agents)
5. Combines GPT models + tools (like calculators, file readers, etc.)
```
